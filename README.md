- 👋 Hi, I’m @danielguaro
- 👀 I’m interested in learning new things, I’m already an environmental engineer, but I wanna try new stuff, that’s why I’m on this platform to rich myself and get new goals
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML5, Java, Python. But I´ll also learn CSS, JS, ReactJS, as soon as possible.
- ⚽/🥽 I love to play football soccer and diving, but I also like to practice any sport.

 As soon as I´ll learn more about GitHub I´ll post more things (hope so 😁)
